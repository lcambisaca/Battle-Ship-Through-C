This project was undertaken as part of my Computing Systems class, where our assignment was to recreate the classic game Battleship. Collaborating with a partner, 
we embarked on developing a battleship game using C. To do this we leveraged N-curses to create an immersive grapical interface where we displayed the player and 
AI boards, allowing players to choose which spot to place their ships and which spot on the grid to shoot. We had 3 states for each grid tile x - hit, s -
ship, and O means empty. Using C memory allocations, we were able to update the state of the game by managing the player and their actions and reflecting 
their effectiveness on the boards. By doing so, we ensured that players could interact intuitively with the interface, making informed decisions about the ship 
placement and responding effectively to AI attacks. The culmination of this effort resulted in a robust and engaging battleship experience that captivated players 
with its immersive gameplay and intuitive user interface.
